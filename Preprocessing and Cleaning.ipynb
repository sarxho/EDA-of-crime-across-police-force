    "##  Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workbook, I cleaned and preprocessed crime data recorded at the street level.  \n",
    "The focus was on four police forces within London and the South East region:\n",
    "**Metropolitan Police, Kent Police, Surrey Police, and Essex Police**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this stage was to create a reliable and consistent dataset for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.  \n",
    "To achieve this, the following steps were carried out:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Imported and combined** monthly CSV files from 2023–2025 for each police force.  \n",
    "- **Standardised column names** for consistency and readability.  \n",
    "- **Checked and removed duplicate rows** to ensure data integrity.  \n",
    "- **Handled missing values** by filling categorical gaps with `\"Unknown\"` and retaining numeric NaNs for later spatial analysis.  \n",
    "- **Removed unnecessary columns** such as `Context` to simplify the dataset.  \n",
    "- **Converted month values** to proper datetime format and created new columns for `year`, `month_number`, and `month_name`.  \n",
    "- **Cleaned text-based columns**  simplifying phrases like `\"On or near\"`.  \n",
    "- **Validated coordinate ranges** to ensure longitude and latitude values were within UK boundaries.  \n",
    "- **Merged** all cleaned data into one final dataset (`All_Forces_Cleaned_2023_2025.csv`) saved in the same directory as the individual files.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cleaning and preprocessing process ensures that the dataset is **consistent, accurate, and ready** for meaningful analysis across regions and time periods.\n",

    "   - Identify the corresponding **police force** from the filename.  \n",
    "   - Identify the **month** from the folder name.  \n",
    "   - Read the file into a DataFrame using `pandas.read_csv()`.  \n",
    "   - Add two new columns:  \n",
    "     - `Police_Force` — to label which force the data belongs to  \n",
    "     - `Month_Folder` — to record which month the data came from\n",
    "3. Each monthly DataFrame was stored inside the appropriate key in `force_data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, I looped through each police force’s list of DataFrames, combined them into one large dataset using `pd.concat()`, and saved each as a new CSV file inside the **Clean_policeforce_data** folder.\n"
