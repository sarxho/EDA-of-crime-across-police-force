# EDA-of-crime-across-police-force
UK street-level crime data across four police forces — Metropolitan Police, Kent Police, Surrey Police, and Essex Police — covering September 2023 to September 2025.  The aim is to clean, merge, and explore monthly crime datasets to uncover regional differences, time-based trends, crime type patterns, and outcome distributions.
